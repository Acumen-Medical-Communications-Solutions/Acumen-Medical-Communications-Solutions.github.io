## <span style="color:#003C68">Summary of Changes Guide</span>

Once the **Acumen Smart Document Solution** software is installed and you re-open Microsoft Word, the “Acumen” tab will appear in the top ribbon of the Word application. This is an access point to activate all of the Acumen Smart Document Solution features and the activation of this is detailed in the [Getting Started](/user_guides/getting_started/) Section of the documentation.

Once the appropriate credentials are entered, new tabs will be visible in the ribbon based on the features in your subscription.

### <span style="color:#003C68; text-decoration:underline">Setup</span> 

Before using the Summary of Changes Tool you'll need to make sure you are tracking changes for the SoC to reference. To turn this feature on, you will need to go to the review tab found on the top bar and then click on the **Track Changes** Icon and enable the Track Changes feature.

<br/>

Once you have Tracked changes then you'll be able to start using our Summary of Changes tool. To do this, go to the **Acumen** Tab and then click the **Create** Button found under the Summary of changes section to create a formatted page detailing the changes done to your Word Document.

<br/>

**NOTE: You should create the Summary of Changes page only after finishing your changes to your document as the Page will only show changes made before creating the Summary of Changes.**

### <span style="color:#003C68; text-decoration:underline">Navigating Summary of Changes</span>

First thing you'll want to do is start making changes to the documentation, while doing this the page will track changes made along the way highlighting them as you go. You should not accept any changes however until after creating the SoC since doing either action will stop the SOC from generatin the appropriate results. If Tracked Changes are working properly, you should be seeing something similar to the image below:

<br/>

Once you've finished your documentation, what you will do next is create the Summary of Changes page and then you can accept the changes you've made. The New SoC Documentation will be broken down into 3 sections, **Synopsis**, **Track Changes** and **Appendix**. 

Below is an example of the **Track Changes** Table which is where a comprehensive table can be found of all changes made on your document.

<br/>

Next is the **Synopsis** section which if a Synopsis is in your Documentation will show the entirity of your Synopsis with any changes done to it in **bold**, **Crossed out**, etc.

Finally the **Appendix** section is where an List of Abbreviations and Specialist Term Changes can be found.
