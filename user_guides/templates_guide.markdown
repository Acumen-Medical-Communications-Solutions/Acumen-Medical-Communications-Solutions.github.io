The **Templates** link in the side navigation panel of the **Authorization Manager** homepage directs you to the page for downloading the Acumen templates. There are **2** general options for dowloading templates.  You can elect to download all templates at once into 1 download by selecting the **download** icon in the **All eCTD Templates** row.

Click the downloaded file to open the zip folder in your file manager window.  The downloaded templates will appear sorted into folders and are ready to be moved into your home working environment for immediate use. The templates were built using the Acumen Smart Document Solution Stylus toolbar and are best used with that tool in the Microsoft Word environment.
