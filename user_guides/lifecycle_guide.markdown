Once the **Acumen Smart Document Solution** software is installed and you re-open Microsoft Word, the “Acumen” tab will appear in the top ribbon of the Word application. This is an access point to activate all of the Acumen Smart Document Solution features and the activation of this is detailed in the [Getting Started](/user_guides/getting_started/) Section of the documentation.

Once the appropriate credentials are entered, new tabs will be visible in the ribbon based on the features in your subscription. If you do not see the **Lifecycle** section on the top ribbon, please log out and log back in (using the supplied credentials).
