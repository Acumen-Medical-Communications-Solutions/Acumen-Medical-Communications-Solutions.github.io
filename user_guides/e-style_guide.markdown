## <span style="color:#003C68">E-Style Guide</span>

Once the **Acumen Smart Document Solution** software is installed and you re-open Microsoft Word, the “Acumen” tab will appear in the top ribbon of the Word application. This is an access point to activate all of the Acumen Smart Document Solution features and the activation of this is detailed in the [Getting Started](/user_guides/getting_started/) Section of the documentation.

Once the appropriate credentials are entered, new tabs will be visible in the ribbon based on the features in your subscription.

### <span style="color:#003C68; text-decoration:underline">Activation</span> 

Use of the features of the **“e-Style”** tab is simple and easy to use

The default setting for this tool is inactive and the icons and functionality are greyed out and unresponsive. To activate the e-Style Guide select your client organization from the **“Client”** drop down menu.

This will trigger the Acumen dictionary to be loaded which will enable an enhanced spellcheck feature.

<br/>

The e-Style Guide drop down menu will populate with the available e-Style Guide(s) for your organization. If you have multiple e-Style Guides to choose from, then just select the appropriate version that you wish to use with your document.

<br/>

The features of the plug-in will now all be usable in your document.

### <span style="color:#003C68; text-decoration:underline">Running Scans</span> 

To run the tool, the user simply checks the settings for the categories that they wish to scan and hit the **“Run e-Style”** icon.

![image](/assets/images/ugeg05.jpg){: style="border:1px solid Silver"}<br>
<br/>

A right-side panel will open in the Word file which will show the progress of the scan.

![image](/assets/images/ugeg06.jpg){: style="border:1px solid Silver"}<br>
<br/>

Once the scan is complete, the findings will appear in a list in the same panel and also as highlights in the Word document.  The categories appear as color-coded highlights for easy recognition of the type of finding.

![image](/assets/images/ugeg07.jpg){: style="border:1px solid Silver"}<br>
<br/>

The use can navigate through the findings either through the panel or by **clicking** on the highlighted finding in the Word file.

Changes are note and replacement text is provided for any finding that the tool flagged.  The user can choose to **“accept”** or **“reject”** any edit.  Also they can **“accept all”** or **“reject all”** of a finding that occurs multiple times.  The findings are counted down in the bottom portion of the panel as they are resolved. Once the findings have been resolved, the user can remove any remaining highlights in the document and simply close out of the panel.

<br/> 

**NOTE: The e-Style Guide can be run as many times in as many configurations as the user wishes or needs to create a clean and document.**

Another feature is the generation of a list of acronyms in a document.  Since the e-Style Guide can scan for known or suspected acronyms used in the file, it has a feature where these acronyms can be compiled into a list. 

![image](/assets/images/ugeg10.jpg){: style="border:1px solid Silver"}<br>
<br/>

The list of acronyms is compiled and open up as a separate Word file. This file can be used to confirm the terms used, to QC the document, or to include within the document as a list of acronyms if needed. 

The output file is a table that shows the acronym found and the definition of the term if it is known to the software backend data.  If not known, then the second column is left blank. Acronyms found that appear 3 or fewer times in the document will be highlighted to flag their infrequent use.

![image](/assets/images/ugeg11.jpg){: style="border:1px solid Silver"}<br>
<br/>

Note that the tool identified anything that appears to be an acronym (ie, contain multiple capitalized letters in a row).  Some findings may not be valid acronyms.

<br/>

<span style="color:#003C68; text-decoration:underline">Configuration</span> 

The e-Style Guide can be configured to run **“micro-scans”** of the document to search for subcategories of the main search settings.  Users can access the web interface to make adjustment to the settings by logging into the **web portal** directly using the credentials provided when the tool was installed.  A shortcut to the web portal is available by clicking the **“Go to Configuration Page”** icon.
 
![image](/assets/images/ugeg13.jpg){: style="border:1px solid Silver"}<br>
<br/>

Once logged into the page, the user navigates to the e-Style Guide page in the top navigation menu. Here the user has several options, they can:

>**1.**
Add terms or rules to the e-Style Guide

>**2.**
Edit run settings for the plug-in

>**3.**
Create additional e-Style Guides modeled off of the main version active.<br>
<br/>
 
![image](/assets/images/ugeg14.jpg){: style="border:1px solid Silver"}<br>
<br/>

The **“Add Terms”** link will bring the user to the configurable content portion of the e-Style Guide.  This is the data backbone of the tool. The user navigates to the section of choice through a left panel navigation and can scroll pages of any subsection through a bottom page counter. 
  
New items can be added to any subsection by completing each cell for an **“Avoid”** and **“Preferred”** term or rule and then clicking **“save”**. A new row will then be automatically created for further additions. Once saved, the terms will automatically alphabetize.  

![image](/assets/images/ugeg15.jpg){: style="border:1px solid Silver"}<br>
<br/>

**NOTE: Additionally, users can delete unwanted terms/rules (2) or reverse terms as needed (3).** 

From the main e-Style Guide page, the **“Run Settings”** link for each of the 3 categories will direct the user to an interface where they can toggle on or off any category or subcategory within the main section.  This is helpful to allow the user to run a targeted scan **(or “micro-scan”)** of the document for just specific style rule that they wish to check. Any combination of search settings is permissible.

![image](/assets/images/ugeg17.jpg){: style="border:1px solid Silver"}<br>
<br/>

By clicking the **“Create e-Style Guide”** button from the main e-Style Guide page, you will be prompted to provide a name for this new style guide.  It will automatically contain the data from the core backbone of information.  The user will simply need to add of terms and rules to distinguish this style guide from other that you may have.  

This feature is helpful if there are different conventions used between product programs or indication.  It allows each sub-style guide to be catered to the specific needs of a program or asset or brand.

<br/>

Once installed, the **“e-Style”** tab will always appear in the Microsoft Word ribbon. 

You will not need to **“reattach”** the plug-in or re-enter your activation credentials. For documents that you choose to use the e-Style Guide features on, you just need to select a list and you are ready to go.
